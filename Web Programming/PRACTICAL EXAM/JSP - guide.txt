(template MUST be implemented)

1.Model-Repository-Service-Controller pattern for each of the operations/entities

2.HTTP => ONLY GET AND POST can be done. No PUT or DELETE operations

3.Model + Repository are straight-forward ; in the repository manual queries can be implemented if something more complex is given

4.Authentication (with roles too) can be done by implementing a users table and then checking for every .jsp page the if the user is logged in using session.setAttribute("user", user);
	-check by using session.getAttribute("user) and check if it is null

-> for every model use Lombok for easy entity, getter, setter, constructors
-> also use @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) - auto-incremented id

5.For Controller use @GetMapping @PostMapping (can be used both for a single url) and ALL SHOULD RETURN A STRING that is the jsp page where the redirect must go.
