1. Configuration part : 

-config.php :   parse the .env file and include the cors configuration
		get the host, username, password, and db name from the .env file.
		try to connect to the database and throw exception if not possible
		
-.env : store here DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME
-cors.php : allow all origin, allow methods (get, post, put, delete, patch), allow headers : Content-Type


2. Mandatory shared.js(process form data) + ajax.js files for AJAX calls (copy)

3. CRUD operation(whatever is needed) in PHP on the format of the assignment.

4. Implementation in JS and call <script> part in HTML to call the JS

5. Rest of the operation are done just as above, but with a modified query, http request and whatever else is needed (ask copilot / chatgpt)

6.Also problem can be solved in a .php file which will contain the server + the js calls and html with some styling also possible

7.Login example in the sample; with user and $_SESSION being begined and ended after a user is logged in. 

REMARKS:
-errors can be seen in the xhr part at the response field(php errors + warnings)
-pay attention to naming variables in DB and in the JS/PHP part(must correspond) 
-ALWAYS set the id as auto increment (!!!)
-ALWAYS USE THE localhost/ NOT THE ONE THAT ALSO HAS PORT EMBEDDED FROM THE WEBSTORM!!!
-2x pay attention to DB names and also FIELD TYPES

!!! DATABASE IS CONFIGURED ALREADY IN MYSQL !!!
